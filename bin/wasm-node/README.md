# Overview

This directory contains the source code of a JavaScript package (in the `javascript` subdirectory)
that makes it possible to connect to Substrate-based chains (such as Polkadot).

The JavaScript package works by instantiating a WebAssembly virtual machine. The `.wasm` file
containing the WebAssembly bytecode is generated by compiling the Rust library found in the
`rust` subdirectory.
