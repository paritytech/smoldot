# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Fix another panic in case of a carefully-crafted LEB128 length. ([#2337](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2337))

## 0.6.17 - 2022-05-31

### Changed

- The networking code has been considerably refactored. Due to the large size of the change it is possible that unintended changes in behaviour have been introduced. ([#2264](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2264))

### Fixed

- Fix a panic in case of a Noise message with an invalid length. ([#2321](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2321))
- Fix a panic in case of a carefully-crafted LEB128 length. ([#2326](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2326))

## 0.6.16 - 2022-05-16

### Added

- Added support for version 1 of the trie. Previously, it wasn't possible to connect to chains that were using version 1. ([#2277](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2277))

### Changed

- The runtime of the genesis block is now only compiled once when a chain is added, decreasing the time this operation takes. ([#2270](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2270))
- Block announces are now propagated to other peers that are also light clients. Light clients should try to connect to as few full nodes as possible (to save resources), but doing so can leave them vulnerable to eclipse attacks. By having light clients connect to other light clients and making them gossip block announces to each other, we increase the likelihood that they detect situations where a given validator generates two blocks during the same slot and is trying to show one of the block only to some peers and the other block to the rest. ([#2226](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2226))

## 0.6.15 - 2022-04-07

### Fixed

- Backport change to checkpoints format (generated by the `sync_state_genSyncSpec` JSON-RPC function of Substrate nodes). Smoldot maintains compatibility with checkpoints generated earlier. ([#2219](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2219))

## 0.6.14 - 2022-04-07

### Fixed

- No longer panic if passed a chain specification containing an invalid bootnode address. Because the specification of the format of a multiaddress is flexible, invalid bootnode addresses do not trigger a hard error but instead are ignored and a warning is printed. ([#2207](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2207))
- Make sure that the tasks of the nodes that have a lot of CPU-heavy operations to perform periodically yield to other tasks, ensuring that the less busy tasks still make progress. This fixes a variety of issues such as chains taking a long time to initialize, or simple JSON-RPC requests taking a long time to be answered. ([#2213](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2213))
- Fix several potential infinite loops when finality lags behind too much ([#2215](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2215)).

## 0.6.13 - 2022-04-05

### Fixed

- Properly fix the regression that version 0.6.12 was supposed to fix. ([#2210](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2210))

## 0.6.12 - 2022-04-04

### Fixed

- Fix regression introduced in version 0.6.11 causing some JSON-RPC functions to never produce a result if they were sent before the runtime of the chain has been downloaded. ([#2201](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2201))

## 0.6.11 - 2022-03-31

### Fixed

- Fix the `ClientOptions.cpuRateLimit` feature being misimplemented and treating any value other than 1.0 as extremely low. ([#2189](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2189))
- Fixed a `TimeoutOverflowWarning` caused by calling `setTimeout` with a value that is too large. ([#2188](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2188))

## 0.6.10 - 2022-03-29

### Fixed

- Fix parachain blocks being reported multiple times in case they have been finalized in-between ([#2182](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2182)).

## 0.6.9 - 2022-03-25

### Fixed

- Properly display error messages when smoldot crashes when in a browser, instead of showing `[object ErrorEvent]`. ([#2171](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2171))

## 0.6.8 - 2022-03-23

### Fixed

- Fix regression introduced in version 0.6.5 where we erroneously removed entries in the mapping of which peer knows which blocks, leading to failures to request data. ([#2168](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2168))

## 0.6.7 - 2022-03-22

### Changed

- Add more details to the debug and trace logs that happen in case of errors such as networking errors or block verification failures ([#2161](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2161)).

### Fixed

- Increase the threshold after which smoldot considers that a protocol name sent through multistream-select is an attempt at a DoS attack, to accomodate for the change in the GrandPa protocol name in Substrate. ([#2162](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2162))

## 0.6.6 - 2022-03-18

### Added

- Add `ClientOptions.cpuRateLimit`, which lets the user put an upper bound on the amount of CPU that the client uses on average ([#2151](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2151)).
- Add support for parsing the "fron" (Frontier) consensus log items in headers. The content of these log items is ignored by the client. ([#2150](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2150))

## 0.6.5 - 2022-03-17

### Changed

- Chain specifications with a `codeSubstitutes` field containing a block hash are no longer supported ([#2127](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2127)).
- Prune list of unverified blocks if it grows too much in order to resist spam attacks ([#2114](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2114)).
- Log block's parent hash in case of block announce ([#2105](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2105)).
- Only call `console.error` once in case of a Rust panic ([#2093](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2093)).

### Fixed

- Fix parachain blocks being reported multiple times in case of a relay chain fork ([#2106](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2106)).
- Implement the `ext_crypto_ecdsa_sign_version_1` host function ([#2120](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2120)).
- Implement the `ext_crypto_ecdsa_verify_version_1` host function ([#2120](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2120)).
- Implement the `ext_crypto_ecdsa_sign_prehashed_version_1` host function ([#2120](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2120)).
- Implement the `ext_crypto_ecdsa_verify_prehashed_version_1` host function ([#2120](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2120)).
- Properly mark all descendants as bad when a block is determined to be bad ([#2121](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/pull/2121)).
