//! Background runtime download service.
//!
//! This service plugs on top of a [`sync_service`], listens for new best blocks and checks
//! whether the runtime has changed in any way. Its objective is to always provide an up-to-date
//! [`executor::host::HostVmPrototype`] ready to be called by other services.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! The runtime service lets user subscribe to best and finalized block updates, similar to
//! the [`sync_service`]. These subscriptions are implemented by subscribing to the underlying
//! [`sync_service`] and, for each notification, downloading the runtime code of the best or
//! finalized block. Therefore, these notifications always come with a delay compared to directly
//! using the [`sync_service`].
//!
//! Furthermore, if it isn't possible to download the runtime code of a block (for example because
//! peers refuse to answer or have already pruned the block) or if the runtime service already has
//! too many pending downloads, this block is simply skipped and not reported on the
//! subscriptions.
//!
//! Consequently, you are strongly encouraged to not use both the [`sync_service`] *and* the
//! [`RuntimeService`] of the same chain. They each provide a consistent view of the chain, but
//! this view isn't necessarily the same on both services.
//!
//! The main service offered by the runtime service is
//! [`RuntimeService::recent_best_block_runtime_call`], that performs a runtime call on the latest
//! reported best block or more recent.
