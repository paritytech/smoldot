//! Imports and exports of the WebAssembly module.
//!
//! This module contains all the functions that tie together the Rust code and its host (i.e.
//! the JavaScript code, normally).
//!
//! The functions found in the `extern` block are the functions that the Rust code *imports*, and
//! need to be implemented on the host side and provided to the WebAssembly virtual machine. The
//! other functions are functions that the Rust code *exports*, and can be called by the host.
//!
//! # About wasi
//!
//! The Rust code is expected to be compiled for the `wasm32-wasi` target, and not just
//! `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. The `wasi` platform is used in order for example to obtain a source
//! of randomness.
//!
//! > **Note**: While wasi could theoretically also be used in order to obtain the current time,
//! >           the Wasi syscall cannot be implemented in pure JavaScript code at the moment, due
//! >           to `u64`s being unusable in Javascript. As such, alternatives are present in the
//! >           `extern` block below.
//!
//! Consequently, the exports found in the `extern` block below are not the only functions that
//! must be implemented. Several functions required by the Wasi ABI are also used. The best place
//! to find documentation at the moment is <https://docs.rs/wasi>.
