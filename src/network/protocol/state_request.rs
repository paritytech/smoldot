//! State requests protocol.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! A state request consists in asking for the remote to send back all the storage entries
//! starting at a specific key. As many storage entries are included in the response as possible,
//! until the response fits the size of 2MiB.
//!
//! After a response has been received, the sender is expected to send back another request (with
//! a start key right after the last key of the response) in order to continue downloading the
//! storage entries.
//!
//! The format of the response is a compact Merkle proof.
//!
//! > **Note**: The implementation in this module always requests a proof from the server.
//! >           Substrate nodes also support a "no proof" mode where, instead of a proof, the list
//! >           of entries are simply returned without any way to verify them. This alternative
//! >           mode is supposed to be used only in situations where the peer the request is sent
//! >           to is trusted. Because this "no proof" mode is very niche, the implementation in
//! >           this module doesn't support it.
//!
//! # AboutÂ child tries
//!
//! For the purpose of this protocol, the content of child tries is as if they existed in the main
//! trie under the key `:child_storage:default:`. For example, the child trie `0xabcd` is
//! considered to be at key `concat(b":child_storage:default:", 0xabcd)`.
//!
//! In the response, the child trie Merkle proof is associated with the main trie entry
//! corresponding to the child trie. In other words, it is as if the child trie entry in the main
//! trie was a branch node, except that it has a value corresponding to the hash of the root of
//! the child trie.
//!
