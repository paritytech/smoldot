//! The identify protocol is a request-response protocol.
//!
//! The request's body is empty. Contrary to other request-response protocols, it doesn't even
//! contain a message length. As soon as the protocol has been negotiated, the other side should
//! send back the response.
//!
//! The response's body consists in various useful general-purpose information about the node.
//! See [`IdentifyResponse`] for details.
//!
//! The two most important fields are [`IdentifyResponse::listen_addrs`] and
//! [`IdentifyResponse::observed_addr`]. They are necessary in order for nodes to discover their
//! public address, and in order to insert peers in the Kademlia k-buckets.
//!
//! See also [the official specification](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/69e57d59dc5d59d3979d79842b577ec2c483f7fa/identify).
