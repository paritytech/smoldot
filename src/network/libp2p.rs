//! Collection of connections and connection attempts.
//!
//! This module provides the [`Network`] data structure that contains a collection of currently
//! open connections, both in handshake mode or not, and pending outgoing connection attempts.
//!
//! This module provides a multithreading-friendly API. All methods accept `&self` rather than
//! `&mut self`, making it possible to use the [`Network`] multiple times from multiple different
//! threads simultaneously.
//!
//! > **Note**: The process power required to encode and decode the encrypted networking
//! >           communications is usually the main CPU consumption reason in a Substrate/Polkadot
//! >           client. In order to avoid running into a bottleneck when the number of peers is
//! >           high, it is recommmended for the user to distribute the various sockets between
//! >           multiple tasks (themselves distributed between multiple CPU cores), and share the
//! >           [`Network`] object between all these tasks.
