//! State machine handling the handshake with a TCP or WebSocket libp2p connection.
//!
//! A connection handshake consists of three steps:
//!
//! - A multistream-select negotiation to negotiate the encryption protocol. Only the noise
//! protocol is supported at the moment.
//! - A noise protocol handshake, where public keys are exchanged and symmetric encryption is
//! initialized.
//! - A multistream-select negotiation to negotiate the yamux protocol. Only the yamux protocol is
//! supported at the moment. This negotiation is performed on top of the noise cipher.
//!
//! This entire handshake requires in total either three or five TCP packets (not including the
//! TCP handshake), depending on the strategy used for the multistream-select protocol.

// TODO: finish commenting on the number of round trips
