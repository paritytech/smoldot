//! "Diff" between a storage and the next.
//!
//! Imagine two `HashMap<Vec<u8>, Vec<u8>>`s representing the storage of the chain. This data
//! structure contains the difference from one to the other.
//!
//! This data structure can be used in a variety of circumstances, such as storing the storage
//! differences between a block and its child or storing on-going changes while a runtime call is
//! being performed. It can also be used to store an entire storage, by representing a diff where
//! the base is an empty storage.
//!
//! # About keys hashing
//!
//! This data structure internally uses a hash map. This hash map assumes that storage keys are
//! already uniformly distributed and doesn't perform any additional hashing.
//!
//! You should be aware that a malicious runtime could perform hash collision attacks that
//! considerably slow down this data structure.
//!
