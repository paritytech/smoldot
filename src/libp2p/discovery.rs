//! Mechanisms related to discovering nodes that are part of a certain overlay network.
//!
//! # Synopsis
//!
//! Internet is a network of computers. The list of machines that are running a Substrate/Polkadot
//! client is a subset of the Internet. This module provides the mechanisms that help finding out
//! which machines (more precisely, which IP address and port) run a Substrate/Polkadot client.
//!
//! # Details
//!
//! Substrate-compatible chains use two discovery mechanisms:
//!
//! - **Kademlia**. All nodes that belong to a certain chain are encouraged to participate in the
//! Kademlia [DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table) of that chain, making it
//! possible to ask a node for the nodes it has learned about in the past.
//! - **mDNS**. By broadcasting UDP packets over the local network, one can find other nodes
//! running the same chain. // TODO: not implemented yet
//!
//! The main discovery mechanism is the DHT. In order to bootstrap this mechanism, a list of nodes
//! known to always be part of the chain is hardcoded in the chain specifications. These nodes are
//! called **boostrap nodes**.
