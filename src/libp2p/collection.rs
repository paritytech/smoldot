//! Collection of libp2p connections.
//!
//! The [`Network`] struct in this module is a collection of libp2p connections. In the
//! documentation below, it is also called the *coordinator*.
//!
//! When a connection is inserted in the collection with [`Network::insert_single_stream`] or
//! [`Network::insert_multi_stream`], two objects are returned: an identifier for this new
//! connection assigned by the collection, and a [`SingleStreamConnectionTask`] or
//! [`MultiStreamConnectionTask`].
//!
//! All the [`SingleStreamConnectionTask`]s/[`MultiStreamConnectionTask`] created by the
//! [`Network`] communicate with that [`Network`] by passing messages. Passing the messages has
//! to be done explicitly by the API user. It is the responsibility of the API user to pull
//! messages from the coordinator (i.e. the [`Network`]) and push them onto the
//! [`SingleStreamConnectionTask`] or [`MultiStreamConnectionTask`] and vice-versa.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! - Whenever a new connection is established, use  [`Network::insert_single_stream`] or
//! [`Network::insert_multi_stream`] to allocate a connection in the collection.
//! - When a connection has received data or is ready to send more data, use
//! [`SingleStreamConnectionTask::read_write`], [`SingleStreamConnectionTask::reset`],
//! [`MultiStreamConnectionTask::substream_read_write`], [`MultiStreamConnectionTask::reset`],
//! [`MultiStreamConnectionTask::add_substream`], and/or
//! [`MultiStreamConnectionTask::desired_outbound_substreams`] to synchronize the state of the
//! task with the actual state of the connection.
//! - Pull messages from the [`SingleStreamConnectionTask`]s and [`MultiStreamConnectionTask`]s
//! and inject them into the [`Network`], and vice versa.
//! - In parallel, continuously call [`Network::next_event`] to process the events generated by
//! the calls to [`Network::inject_connection_message`].
//!
