//! Optimistic headers-only syncing.
//!
//! Optimistic syncing consists in assuming that all sources of blocks form the same chain. A
//! query for blocks is performed on a random source, and the response is verified. If it turns
//! out that the source doesn't belong to the same chain (or is malicious), a different source
//! is tried.
//!
//! While this syncing strategy is very simplistic, it is the most effective when the majority of
//! sources are well-behaved, which is normally the case.
//!
//! The [`OptimisticHeadersSync`] makes it possible to sync the finalized blocks of a chain, but
//! not the non-finalized blocks.
