//! WebSocket server.
//!
//! Only handles text frames from the WebSocket protocol. While adding support for binary frames
//! isn't difficult, it is out of scope of the use-case of this code.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Call [`WsServer::new`], passing a [`Config`], in order to create a listening TCP socket
//! wrapped inside of a [`WsServer`].
//!
//! After initialization, call [`WsServer::next_event`] in order to wait for something to happen
//! on the listening TCP socket or on one of the currently active clients that have connected.
//!
//! When [`Event::ConnectionOpen`] is returned, call [`WsServer::accept`] or [`WsServer::reject`]
//! to either accept or refuse the new incoming connection. The
//! [`ConnectionOpen`](Event::ConnectionOpen) event holds the [`SocketAddr`] of the client, which
//! can be used to make a decision. This module doesn't enforce any limit to the number of
//! simultaneously connected client. In order to enforce one (which is recommended), call
//! [`WsServer::reject`] if [`WsServer::len`] is superior or equal to a certain value.
//!
//! Each active client connection is identified with a [`ConnectionId`], provided when
//! [`accept`](WsServer::accept) is called. Call [`WsServer::close`] in order to forcefully shut
//! down a certain connection. An [`Event::ConnectionError`] event is returned by
//! [`next_event`](WsServer::next_event) if the client shuts down its side of the connection or
//! if a protocol error is detected. Calling [`close`](WsServer::close) does *not* generate a
//! [`ConnectionError`](Event::ConnectionError) event, as the closing is assumed to be
//! instantaneous for API-related purposes.
//!
//! After either [`close`](WsServer::close) is called or
//! [`ConnectionError`](Event::ConnectionError) is returned, the given [`ConnectionId`] is no
//! longer valid and can later get reused for a different connection.
//!
//! When [`accept`](WsServer::accept) is called, a "user data" parameter must be passed. This is
//! a value opaque to the code in this module that can be used by the API user in order to hold
//! additional connection-specific state.
//!
//! Use [`WsServer::queue_send`] to send a text frame to a client. The message is buffered and
//! will be progressively delivered when the client is ready to receive it.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! # async fn foo() {
//! use substrate_lite::json_rpc::websocket_server::{Config, Event, WsServer};
//!
//! let mut server = WsServer::new(Config {
//!     bind_address: "127.0.0.1:0".parse().unwrap(),
//!     max_frame_size: 1024 * 1024,
//!     send_buffer_len: 32,
//!     capacity: 32,
//! })
//! .await
//! .unwrap();
//!
//! loop {
//!     match server.next_event().await {
//!         // New connection on the listener.
//!         Event::ConnectionOpen { address } => {
//!             println!("New connection from {:?}", address);
//!             if server.len() < 512 {
//!                 // Rather than passing `()`, it is possible to pass any value. The value is
//!                 // provided back on `TextFrame` and `ConnectionError` events.
//!                 server.accept(());
//!             } else {
//!                 server.reject();
//!             }
//!         }
//!
//!         // Received a message from a connection.
//!         Event::TextFrame { message, connection_id, .. } => {
//!             println!("Received message: {:?}", message);
//!             server.queue_send(connection_id, "hello back!".to_string());
//!         },
//!
//!         // Connection has been closed.
//!         Event::ConnectionError { .. } => {},
//!     }
//! }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # About performances
//!
//! The [`WsServer`] is entirely single-threaded, as calling [`WsServer::next_event`] is the only
//! way to process the state of all the sockets and it requires a mutable borrow to the server.
//!
//! This restriction to being single-threaded only becomes a problem if a single CPU core isn't
//! capable of processing the volume of data, which is expected to happen only with a very large
//! number of clients (the complexity being `O(n)`).
//!
//! The single-threadedness can even be beneficial when the WebSocket server isn't the primary
//! *raison d'Ãªtre* of a certain program, which is what this module has been designed for. In the
//! case of a (D)DoS attack on the WebSocket server, only up to one core of CPU processing power
//! can be occupied by the attacker.
