//! Events retrieval and decoding.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! While this behaviour is not part of the specification and is thus not a strict requirement,
//! Substrate-compatible blockchains built using the Substrate framework provide a storage item
//! (in other words, an entry in the storage, with a specific key) containing a list of so-called
//! *events*. This storage item is updated at each block with the events that have happened in
//! the latest block.
//!
//! > **Note**: Events include, for example, a transfer between two accounts, a change in the
//! >           validators nominated by a nominator, the beginning of a referundum, etc.
//!
//! This module provides the tooling necessary to help retrieve said events.
//!
//! In order to determine which storage key holds the list of events, one needs to provide the
//! *metadata*. See the [metadata](crate::metadata) module for information about what the metadata
//! is and how to obtain it.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! In order to know the events that have happened during a specific block:
//!
//! - Obtain the *metadata* of the runtime used by the desired block. This is out of scope of this
//! module. See the [metadata](crate::metadata) module for more information.
//! - Call [`events_storage_key`] in order to obtain a key where to find the list of events in the
//! storage. If [`events_storage_key`] returns an error, the runtime most likely doesn't support
//! events.
//! - Obtain the storage value corresponding to the key obtained at the previous step. This is out
//! of scope of this module. If there is no storage value at this key, this most likely indicates
//! a bug somewhere, either in substrate-lite or in the runtime.
//! - Decode the events. This isn't implemented in this module yet. See the next section.
//!
//! # Flaw in the design
//!
//! In the SCALE codec, each field is put one behind the other in an unstructured way. The start
//! of a new field is known by adding the length of all the preceding fields, and the length of
//! a field depends on the type of data it contains. The type of data is not explicitly laid out
//! and is only known through context.
//!
//! The list of events (encoded using SCALE) contains, amongst other things, the values of the
//! parameters of said event. In order to be able decode this list of events, one has to know the
//! types of these parameter values. This information is found in the metadata, in the form of a
//! string representing the type as written out in the original Rust source code. This type could
//! be anything, from a primitive type (e.g. `u32`) to a type alias (`type Foo = ...;`), or a
//! locally-defined struct.
//!
//! In order to properly decode events, one has to parse these strings representing Rust types
//! and hard-code a list of types known to be used in the runtime code. This ranges from `u32` to
//! for example `EthereumAddress`.
//!
//! Runtime upgrades can introduce new types and (albeit unlikely) modify the definition of
//! existing types. As such, a function that decodes events can stop working after any runtime
//! upgrade. For this reason, smoldot doesn't provide any such function.
//!
//! In the future, it is planned to add, in Substrate, runtime type information to the metadata,
//! thus allowing a proper decoding function to be implemented. When that is done, smoldot can be
//! updated to support decoding events.
//!
