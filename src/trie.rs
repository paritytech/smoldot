//! Radix-16 Merkle-Patricia trie.
//!
//! This Substrate/Polkadot-specific radix-16 Merkle-Patricia trie is a data structure that
//! associates keys with values, and that allows efficient verification of the integrity of the
//! data.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The key-value storage that the blockchain maintains is represented by
//! [a tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_data_structure), where each key-value pair in the
//! storage corresponds to a node in that tree.
//!
//! Each node in this tree has what is called a Merkle value associated to it. This Merkle value
//! consists, in its essence, in the combination of the storage value associated to that node and
//! the Merkle values of all of the node's children. If the resulting Merkle value would be too
//! long, it is first hashed.
//!
//! Since the Merkle values of a node's children depend, in turn, of the Merkle value of their
//! own children, we can say that the Merkle value of a node depends on all of the node's
//! descendants.
//!
//! Consequently, the Merkle value of the root node of the tree depends on the storage values of
//! all the nodes in the tree.
//!
//! See also [the Wikipedia page for Merkle tree for a different
//! explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree).
//!
//! ## Efficient updates
//!
//! When a storage value gets modified, the Merkle value of the root node of the tree also gets
//! modified. Thanks to the tree layout, we don't need to recalculate the Merkle value of the
//! entire tree, but only of the ancestors of the node which has been modified.
//!
//! If the storage consists of N entries, recalculating the Merkle value of the trie root requires
//! on average only `log16(N)` operations.
//!
//! ## Proof of storage entry
//!
//! In the situation where we want to know the storage value associated to a node, but we only
//! know the Merkle value of the root of the trie, it is possible to ask a third-party for the
//! unhashed Merkle values of the desired node and all its ancestors.
//!
//! After having verified that the third-party has provided correct values, and that they match
//! the expected root node Merkle value known locally, we can extract the storage value from the
//! Merkle value of the desired node.
//!
//! # Details
//!
//! This data structure is a tree composed of nodes, each node being identified by a key. A key
//! consists in a sequence of 4-bits values called *nibbles*. Example key: `[3, 12, 7, 0]`.
//!
//! Some of these nodes contain a value.
//!
//! A node A is an *ancestor* of another node B if the key of A is a prefix of the key of B. For
//! example, the node whose key is `[3, 12]` is an ancestor of the node whose key is
//! `[3, 12, 8, 9]`. B is a *descendant* of A.
//!
//! Nodes exist only either if they contain a value, or if their key is the longest shared prefix
//! of two or more nodes that contain a value. For example, if nodes `[7, 2, 9, 11]` and
//! `[7, 2, 14, 8]` contain a value, then node `[7, 2]` also exist, because it is the longest
//! prefix shared between the two.
//!
//! The *Merkle value* of a node is composed, amongst other things, of its associated value and of
//! the Merkle value of its descendants. As such, modifying a node modifies the Merkle value of
//! all its ancestors. Note, however, that modifying a node modifies the Merkle value of *only*
//! its ancestors. As such, the time spent calculating the Merkle value of the root node of a trie
//! mostly depends on the number of modifications that are performed on it, and only a bit on the
//! size of the trie.
