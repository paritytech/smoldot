//! GrandPa commits contain a proof of the finality of a block.
//!
//! In order to finalize a block, GrandPa authorities must emit votes, also called pre-commits.
//! We consider a block finalized when more than two thirds of the authorities have voted for that
//! block (or one of its descendants) to be finalized.
//!
//! A commit contains all the votes that have been used to prove that a certain block has been
//! finalized.
//!
//! Contrary to justifications, commits don't include the block headers of the forks that have
//! been voted on. It is expected for the node to be aware of these headers through a separate
//! mechanism.
//!
//! When a commit is received from a third party, it must first be verified. See the [`verify`]
//! module.
