//! *All-forks* header and body syncing.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! This state machine holds:
//!
//! - A list of sources of blocks, maintained by the API user.
//!  - For each source, a list of blocks hashes known by the source.
//! - The latest known finalized block.
//! - A tree of valid non-finalized blocks that all descend from the latest known finalized block.
//! - (if full mode) A list of block headers whose body is currently being downloaded.
//! - A list of block header waiting to be verified and whose ancestry with the latest finalized
//!   block is currently unknown.
//!
//! The state machine has the objective to synchronize the tree of non-finalized blocks with its
//! equivalent on the sources added by the API user.
//!
//! Because it is not possible to predict which block in this tree is going to be finalized in
//! the future, the entire tree needs to be synchronized.
//!
//! > **Example**: If the latest finalized block is block number 4, and the tree contains blocks
//! >              5, 6, and 7, and a source announces a block 5 that is different from the
//! >              locally-known block 5, a block request will be emitted for this block 5, even
//! >              if it is certain that this "other" block 5 will not become the local best
//! >              block. This is necessary in case it is this other block 5 that will end up
//! >              being finalized.
//!
//! # Full vs non-full
//!
//! The [`Config::full`] option configures whether the state machine only holds headers of the
//! non-finalized blocks (`full` equal to `false`), or the headers, and bodies, and storage
//! (`full` equal to `true`).
//!
//! In full mode, .
//!
//! # Bounded and unbounded containers
//!
//! It is important to limit the memory usage of this state machine no matter how the
//! potentially-malicious sources behave.
//!
//! The state in this state machine can be put into three categories:
//!
//! - Each source of blocks has a certain fixed-size state associated to it (containing for
//!   instance its best block number and height). Each source also has up to one in-flight
//!   request, which might incur more memory usage. Managing this additional request is out of
//!   scope of this module. The user of this module is expected to limit the number of
//!   simultaneous sources.
//!
//! - A set of verified blocks that descend from the latest finalized block. This set is
//!   unbounded. The consensus and finalization algorithms of the chain are supposed to limit
//!   the number of possible blocks in this set.
//!
//! - A set of blocks that can't be verified yet. Receiving a block announce inserts an element
//!   in this set. In order to handle situations where a malicious source announces lots of
//!   invalid blocks, this set must be bounded. Once it has reached a certain size, the blocks
//!   with the highest block number are discarded if their parent is also in this set or being
//!   downloaded from a source.
//!
//! Consequently, and assuming that the number of simultaneous sources is bounded, and that
//! the consensus and finalization algorithms of the chain are properly configured, malicious
//! sources can't indefinitely grow the state in this state machine.
//! Malicious sources, however, can potentially increase the number of block requests required to
//! download a long fork. This is, at most, an annoyance, and not a vulnerability.
//!
