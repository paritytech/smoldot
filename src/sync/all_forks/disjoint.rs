//! Collection of "disjoint" blocks, in other words blocks whose existence is known but which
//! can't be verified yet.
//!
//! > **Example**: The local node knows about block 5. A peer announces block 7. Since the local
//! >              node doesn't know block 6, it has to store block 7 for later, then download
//! >              block 6. The container in this module is where block 7 is temporarily stored.
//!
//! Each block stored in this collection has the following properties associated to it:
//!
//! - A height.
//! - A hash.
//! - An optional parent block hash.
//! - Whether the block is known to be bad.
//! - A opaque user data decided by the user of type `TBl`.
//!
//! This data structure is only able to link parent and children together if the heights are
//! linearly increasing. For example, if block A is the parent of block B, then the height of
//! block B must be equal to the height of block A plus one. Otherwise, this data structure will
//! not be able to detect the parent-child relationship.
//!
//! If a block is marked as bad, all its children (i.e. other blocks in the collection whose
//! parent hash is the bad block) are automatically marked as bad as well. This process is
//! recursive, such that not only direct children but all descendants of a bad block are
//! automatically marked as bad.
//!
