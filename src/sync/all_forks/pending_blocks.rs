//! State machine managing the "disjoint" blocks, in other words blocks whose existence is known
//! but which can't be verified yet.
//!
//! > **Example**: The local node knows about block 5. A peer announces block 7. Since the local
//! >              node doesn't know block 6, it has to store block 7 for later, then download
//! >              block 6. The container in this module is where block 7 is temporarily stored.
//!
//! In addition to a set of blocks, this data structure also stores a set of sources of blocks,
//! and ongoing requests that related to these blocks.
//!
//! > **Note**: In the example above, it would store the request that asks for block 6 from the
//! >           network.
//!
//! # Sources
//!
//! The [`PendingBlocks`] collection stores a list of sources of blocks.
//!
//! Sources can be added by calling [`PendingBlocks::add_source`] and removed by calling
//! [`PendingBlocks::remove_source`].
//!
//! Each source has the following properties:
//!
//! - A [`SourceId`].
//! - A best block.
//! - A list of non-finalized blocks known by this source.
//! - An opaque user data, of type `TSrc`.
//!
//! # Blocks
//!
//! The [`PendingBlocks`] collection stores a list of pending blocks.
//!
//! Blocks are expected to be added to this collection whenever we hear about them from a source
//! of blocks (such as a peer) and that it is not possible to verify them immediately (because
//! their parent isn't known).
//!
//! Blocks can be added by calling [`PendingBlocks::insert_unverified_block`] and remove by
//! calling [`PendingBlocks::remove`].
//!
//! Each block stored in this collection has the following properties associated to it:
//!
//! - A height.
//! - A hash.
//! - An optional parent block hash.
//! - Whether the block is known to be bad.
//! - A opaque user data decided by the user of type `TBl`.
//!
//! This data structure is only able to link parent and children together if the heights are
//! linearly increasing. For example, if block A is the parent of block B, then the height of
//! block B must be equal to the height of block A plus one. Otherwise, this data structure will
//! not be able to detect the parent-child relationship.
//!
//! If a block is marked as bad, all its children (i.e. other blocks in the collection whose
//! parent hash is the bad block) are automatically marked as bad as well. This process is
//! recursive, such that not only direct children but all descendants of a bad block are
//! automatically marked as bad.
//!
//! # Requests
//!
//! Call [`PendingBlocks::desired_requests`] or [`PendingBlocks::source_desired_requests`] to
//! obtain the list of requests that should be started.
//!
//! Call [`PendingBlocks::add_request`] to allocate a new [`RequestId`] and add a new request.
//! Call [`PendingBlocks::finish_request`] to destroy a request after it has finished or been
//! cancelled. Note that this method doesn't require to be passed the response to that request.
//! The user is encouraged to update the state machine according to the response, but this must
//! be done manually.
//!
