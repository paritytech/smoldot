//! Client for Polkadot and Substrate-compatible chains.
//!
//! # Overview of a blockchain
//!
//! A blockchain is, in its essence, a distributed and decentralized key-value database. The
//! principle of a blockchain is to make it possible for any participant to perform modifications
//! to this database, and for all participants to eventually agree on the current state of said
//! database.
//!
//! In Polkadot and Substrate-compatible chains, the state of this database is referred to as
//! "the storage". The storage can be seen more or less as a very large `HashMap`.
//!
//! A blockchain therefore consists in three main things:
//!
//! - The initial state of the storage at the moment when the blockchain starts.
//! - A list of blocks, where each block represents a group of modifications performed to the
//! storage.
//! - A peer-to-peer network of clients connected to each other and exchanging information such
//! as newly-produced blocks.
//!
//! Blocks are built on top of each other, forming a sequential list of modifications to the
//! storage on top of its initial state.
//!
//! ## Blocks
//!
//! A block primarily consists in three properties:
//!
//! - A parent block, referred to by its hash.
//! - An ordered list of **extrinsics**. An extrinsic can be either a **transaction** or an
//! **intrisic**.
//! - A list of digest items, which include for example a cryptographic signature of the block
//! made by its author.
//!
//! In order to make abstractions easier, there alsos exists what is called the genesis block, or
//! block number 0. It doesn't have any parent, extrinsic, or digest item. The state of the
//! storage of the genesis block is the initial state.
//!
//! From these three block properties, we can derive:
//!
//! - The hash of the block. This is a unique 256 bits identifier obtained by hashing all the
//! information together in a specific way.
//! - The block number. It is equal to the parent's block number plus one, or equal to zero for
//! the genesis block
//! - The state of the storage at the height of the block.The state at the height of the block
//! consists in the state of the parent block on top of which we have applied the block's
//! extrinsics on top of each other.
//!
//! ## Trie
//!
//! The **trie** is a data structure that plays an important part in the way a blockchain
//! functions. It consists in a tree of keys and values whose content can be hashed. This hash is
//! commonly designated as "the Merkle trie root" or "the trie root".
//! See the [`trie`] module for more details.
//!
//! ## Block headers
//!
//! A block's header contains the following information:
//!
//! - The hash of the parent block.
//! - The block number.
//! - The state trie root, which consists in the trie root of all the keys and values of the
//! storage after this block's modifications have been applied.
//! - The extrinsics trie root, which consists in the Merkle root of a trie containing the
//! extrinsics of the block.
//! - The list of digest items.
//!
//! ## Finalization
//!
//! Each block of a chain can be or not **finalized** in the context of a given chain. Once a
//! block has been finalized, we consider as invalid any block that is not a descendant of it. In
//! other words, a finalized block can never be reverted and is forever part of the chain.
//!
//! By extension, the parent of a finalized block must be finalized as well. The genesis block of
//! a chain is by definition always finalized.
//!
//! # TODO: what's a justification?
//!
