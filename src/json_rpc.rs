//! JSON-RPC servers. Trusted access to the blockchain.
//!
//! # Context
//!
//! The traditional model used in the blockchain ecosystem is this one:
//!
//! ```notrust
//!
//! +---------------+              +--------+            +----------------------+
//! |               |   JSON-RPC   |        |   libp2p   |                      |
//! |  Application  |  <-------->  |  Node  |  <------>  |  Blockchain network  |
//! |  (e.g. a UI)  |              |        |            |                      |
//! +---------------+              +--------+            +----------------------+
//!
//! ```
//!
//! The node is connected to the blockchain network using the libp2p protocol, and one or more
//! applications are connected to the node using the JSON-RPC protocol.
//!
//! > **Note**: An example application that can be put on top of a node is
//! >           [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/).
//!
//! Contrary to the traffic with the blockchain network, the communication between the JSON-RPC
//! client (i.e. the application) and the JSON-RPC server (i.e. the node) is not trustless. In
//! other words, the client has no way to check the accuracy of what the server sends, and
//! therefore trusts that the server isn't malicious. The role of the node is precisely to turn
//! untrusted data coming from the blockchain network into trusted information.
//!
//! The trust goes the other way around: some of the JSON-RPC requests that the client can perform
//! can modify the configuration of the node, while some others are very CPU or I/O-intensive. As
//! such, the server also trusts the client to not be malicious.
//!
//! # JSON-RPC protocol
//!
//! The protocol used is the JSON-RPC v2.0 protocol described [here](https://www.jsonrpc.org/),
//! with two extensions:
//!
//! - The pub-sub extension, as described
//!   [here](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Interact/APIs/RPC-PubSub/).
//! - The method named `rpc_methods` returns a list of all methods available.
//!

// TODO: write docs about usage ^
