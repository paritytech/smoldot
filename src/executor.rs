//! WebAssembly runtime code execution.
//!
//! WebAssembly (often abbreviated *Wasm*) plays a big role in Substrate/Polkadot. The storage of
//! each block in the chain has a special key named `:code` which contains the WebAssembly code
//! of what we call *the runtime*.
//!
//! The runtime is a program (in WebAssembly) that decides, amongst other things, whether
//! transactions are valid and how to apply them on the storage, and whether blocks themselves are
//! valid.
//!
//! This module contains everything necessary to execute runtime code. The highest-level
//! sub-module is [`runtime_host`].
