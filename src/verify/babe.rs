//! BABE consensus.
//!
//! BABE, or Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension, is the consensus algorithm used by
//! Polkadot in order to determine who is authorized to generate a block.
//!
//! Every block (with the exception of the genesis block) must contain, in its header, some data
//! that makes it possible to verify that it has been generated by a legitimate author.
//!
//! References:
//!
//! - https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/BABE/Babe.html
//!
//! # Overview of BABE
//!
//! In the BABE algorithm, time is divided into non-overlapping **epochs**, themselves divided
//! into **slots**. How long an epoch and a slot are is determined by calling the
//! `BabeApi_configuration` runtime entry point.
//!
//! > **Note**: As example values, in the Polkadot genesis, a slot lasts for 6 seconds and an
//! >           epoch consists of 2400 slots (in other words, four hours).
//!
//! Every block that is produced must belong to a specific slot. This slot number can be found in
//! the block header, with the exception of the genesis block which is considered timeless and
//! doesn't have any slot number.
//!
//! At the moment, the current slot number is determined purely based on the slot duration (e.g.
//! 6 seconds for Polkadot) and the local clock based on the UNIX EPOCH. The current slot
//! number is `unix_timestamp / duration_per_slot`. This might change in the future.
//!
//! The first epoch (epoch number 0) starts at `slot_number(block #1)` and ends at
//! `slot_number(block #1) + slots_per_epoch`. The second epoch (epoch #1) starts at slot
//! `end_of_epoch_1 + 1`. All epochs end at `start_of_new_epoch + slots_per_epoch`. Block #0
//! doesn't belong to any epoch.
//!
//! The header of first block produced after a transition to a new epoch (including block #1) must
//! contain a log entry indicating the public keys that are allowed to sign blocks, alongside with
//! a weight for each of them, and a "randomness value". This information does not concern the
//! newly-started epoch, but the one immediately after. In other words, the first block of epoch
//! `N` contains the information about epoch `N+1`.
//!
//! > **Note**: The way the list of authorities and their weights is determined is at the
//! >           discretion of the runtime code and is out of scope of this module, but it normally
//! >           corresponds to the list of validators and how much stake is available to them.
//!
//! In order to produce a block, one must generate, using a
//! [VRF (Verifiable Random Function)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_random_function),
//! and based on the slot number, genesis hash, and aformentioned "randomness value",
//! a number whose value is lower than a certain threshold.
//!
//! The number that has been generated must be included in the header of the authored block,
//! alongside with the proof of the correct generation that can be verified using one of the
//! public keys allowed to generate blocks in that epoch. The weight associated to that public key
//! determines the allowed threshold.
//!
//! The "randomess value" of an epoch `N` is calculated by combining the generated numbers of all
//! the blocks of the epoch `N - 2`.
//!
//! ## Secondary slots
//!
//! While all slots can be claimed by generating a number below a certain threshold, each slot is
//! additionally assigned to a specific public key amongst the ones allowed. The owner of a
//! public key is always allowed to generate a block during the slot assigned to it.
//!
//! The mechanism of attributing each slot to a public key is called "secondary slot claims",
//! while the mechanism of generating a number below a certain threshold is called a "primary
//! slot claim". As their name indicates, primary slot claims have a higher priority over
//! secondary slot claims.
//!
//! Secondary slot claims are a way to guarantee that all slots can potentially lead to a block
//! being produced.
//!
//! ## Chain selection
//!
//! The "best" block of a chain in the BABE algorithm is the one with the highest slot number.
//! If there exists multiple blocks on the same slot, the best block is one with the highest number
//! of primary slot claims. In other words, if two blocks have the same parent, but one is a
//! primary slot claim and the other is a secondary slot claim, we prefer the one with the primary
//! slot claim.
//!
//! Keep in mind that there can still be draws in terms of primary slot claims count, in which
//! case the winning block is the one upon which the next block author builds upon.
//!
//! ## Epochs 0 and 1
//!
//! The information about an epoch `N` is provided by the first block of the epoch `N-1`.
//!
//! Because of this, we need to special-case epoch 0. The information about epoch 0 is contained
//! in the chain-wide BABE configuration found in the runtime. The first block of epoch 0 is the
//! block number #1. The information about epoch 1 is therefore contained in block #1.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! In order to verify a Babe block, two of the main information to pass are:
//!
//! - The [`chain_information::BabeEpochInformationRef`] struct corresponding to the epoch the
//! parent block belongs to.
//! - The [`chain_information::BabeEpochInformationRef`] struct of the epoch that follows.
//!
//! When verifying block number 1, [`VerifyConfig::parent_block_epoch`] must be set to `None` and
//! [`VerifyConfig::parent_block_next_epoch`] must be set to the definition of epoch #0 as
//! determined by performing runtime calls.
//!
//! Any time verifying a block produces a `Some` in [`VerifySuccess::epoch_transition_target`],
//! which is guarateed to be the case when verifying block number 1, an epoch transition occurs.
//! When verifying a child of such block, the value formerly passed as
//! [`VerifyConfig::parent_block_next_epoch`] must now be passed as
//! [`VerifyConfig::parent_block_epoch`], and the value in
//! [`VerifySuccess::epoch_transition_target`] becomes [`VerifyConfig::parent_block_next_epoch`].
//!
//! When designing around these rules, be aware of forks: there can be multiple blocks at the same
//! height performing epoch transitions.
//!
//! See also the [`crate::chain::chain_information`] module for more help.
