  # This job is run after a pull request workflow has completed, potentially from a fork
  # repository. It downloads the artifact output of the workflow, then comments in the pull
  # request accordingly.
  #
  # The reason why this is necessary is that the workflow of the pull request itself doesn't
  # have the authorization to post comments (or any other "write" access action) to avoid people
  # opening pull requests that modify workflows and execute arbitrary code.
  # Instead, this workflow here is always taken from the base branch.
